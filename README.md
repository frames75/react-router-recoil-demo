# Articles explaining the code

I've written two articles in my blog explaining these packages used in this app:

- [React Router v6](https://www.frames75.com/2021/ejemplo-react-router.html)
- [React Recoil](https://www.frames75.com/2022/ejemplo-react-recoil.html)


# Warning about deploying React Apps on GitHub Pages

As stated in the [official documentation of Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#notes-on-client-side-routing), "*GitHub Pages doesn’t support routers that use the HTML5 pushState history API under the hood (for example, React Router using browserHistory)*". Because of this, it's necessary to add the `basename` parameter into the `<BrowserRouter>` tag:

```html
<BrowserRouter basename="/react-router-recoil-demo">
```

On the other hand, on the `package.json` file we must change the build script to copy the index into the 404 page that gets served (as described in [this CRA Repo Issue](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/1765#issuecomment-443598257)):

```json
"build": "react-scripts build && cp build/index.html build/404.html",
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
